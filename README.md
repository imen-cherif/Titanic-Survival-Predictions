# Titanic-Survival-Predictions

The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets used for machine learning algorithms. Its purpose is to describe the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. 
111 Years after the dramatic sinking of the ship, the objective of this notebook is to predict who of the passengers survived and who could not make it. 
Some of the code lines used were inspired from this Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nadintamer/titanic-survival-predictions-beginner .
